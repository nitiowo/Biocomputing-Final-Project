#The graphs that support the questions will appear toward the bottom
#I have included the answers here to reduce the amount of searching required to find them
#The directory paths at lines 37, 51, 59, and 65 will need to be properly set before executing the code
#In supportingFunctions.R the two filepaths leading to the all.csv file on line 69 will need to be properly set before executing the code
#Once paths are set if you hold down ctrl and hold down enter until R gets through all of the code the graphs should appear after about 10-30 seconds
#Main reason for this delay is the for loop around line 113 and the custom function on line 74 that creates one of the graphs


#Answer to Question 1: Supported with graph produced by code towards bottom
#As shown in the graph to the right, Country X has new cases from the first day of testing until the last day of testing.
#Country Y, however did not have any positive cases until about day 140 of testing.
#This indicates that the disease outbreak likely began in Country X.

#Answer to Question 2: Supported with graph produced by code towards bottom
#As shown by the bar graph, there are more occurrences of marker 4 and 5 for country Y than
#there are for country X, and there are far fewer occurrences of markers 7 - 10 for
#country Y than there are for country X. This indicates that a vaccine developed by country Y
#will most likely be targeting a mutated form of the disease-causing agent, rather than the
#form of the agent afflicting country X. Based on this evidence it is reasonable to say that
#the vaccine is unlikely to work as well (if at all) for the citizens of Country X as it does
#for the citizens of Country Y.



#clear previous contents

#load the packages used by the code

library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)



#Use the functions created in supportingFunctions.R to accomplish data transformation and compilation

###From part 1: Use custom function convertdirectorytocsv() to convert all .txt files in countryY directory to .csv files
#Usage: convertdirectorytocsv(directory_containing_country_.txt_files)
convertdirectorytocsv("C:/Users/jwmag/OneDrive/Desktop/Intro_to_biocomputing/Final_Project/Biocomputing-Final-Project/countryY")



###From part 2:
##use custom function to compile all files in country X database
#Usage: many2onecsv(directory_containing_country_.csv_files, option_on_how_to_handle_NA_values)
#User can select "warn" or "remove" as option for how to deal with NAs in data. Default is "do_nothing"
many2onecsv("C:/Users/jwmag/OneDrive/Desktop/Intro_to_biocomputing/Final_Project/Biocomputing-Final-Project/countryX/","do_nothing")

#use custom function to compile all files in country Y database and append them to the compiled data created from country X database
#This function can continued to be called, by replacing the directory name with whatever country has a directory of compiled .csv files
#Usage: many2onecsv(directory_containing_country_.csv_files, option_on_how_to_handle_NA_values)
#User can select "warn" or "remove" as option for how to deal with NAs in data. Default is "do_nothing"
many2onecsv("C:/Users/jwmag/OneDrive/Desktop/Intro_to_biocomputing/Final_Project/Biocomputing-Final-Project/countryY/","do_nothing")



###From part 3:
#Use a custom function to summarize compiled data in newly created all.csv file
#After running part 2 above, user's current working directory should be directory containing all.csv file
#The user will need to input the file name of the data they want to summarize and will need to be in the correct working directory
#Usage: sumview(data_file_name_of_data_want_summary_for)
sumview("all.csv")




#####For supporting answers to questions 1 and 2
#custom function that converts the data in all.csv and creates a data frame for each graph used to support answers to the questions
#data frames produces will be final_df_for_analysis and final_dt_for_bar_plot
#new directory needs to be set before running
#set wd to directory with the all.csv file

#load the combined data from all countries and name it "data"
data<-read.csv("all.csv")

#now i can create a dataframe for Country X and Country Y with the applicable Titles and empty rows
dfcx <- data.frame("Marker_01_X" = integer(), "Marker_02_X" = integer(), "Marker_03_X" = integer(), "Marker_04_X" = integer(), "Marker_05_X" = integer(), "Marker_06_X" = integer(), "Marker_07_X" = integer(), "Marker_08_X" = integer(), "Marker_09_X" = integer(), "Marker_10_X" = integer(), "Cumulative_Pos_X" = integer(), "DayofYear_X" = integer(), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#Since I will not need gender or age columns to answer the following questions I can remove them. I can always append them back in later if needed for other statistical analysis.
#I can remove them using grepl() or "grep logic"
#I could also use
#data$gender = NULL
#data$age = NULL

data = data[,!grepl("age", names(data))]
data = data[,!grepl("gender", names(data))]


#now I will use loops to look through each row in "data"
#I will be using these loops to place any positive cases from country X into a data frame
#And I will be placing any positive cases from country Y into a separate data frame
#I will do this by first checking the row to see what country the data pertains to
#Then I will look through each marker in that row to determine if there is a positive marker
#As soon as a positive marker is detected, the nested for loop will "break", the data will be placed into the next row in the corresponding countries dataframe
#And the next row will be looked at by the starting for loop

#Now that I have all the positive cases from country X and country Y in separate data frames, I can
#Analyze the total number of markers and subjects that were listed for each day of the year
#I will end up with one row for each day of the year, that will include the cumulative total up through that day for both the individual markers and the subjects
#I will create new data files for each country (dfcxcum and dfcycum)

#First I will get the range of days over which testing occured to determine the size of the blank data frames

#determine what the first day of the year testing was performed
first_day = min(data$dayofYear)

#determine what the last day of the year testing was performed
last_day = max(data$dayofYear)

#create a vector that is the length of the range (this should match with the DayofYear column in dfcxcum and dfcycum)
#since we are comparing x and y we will want both to have the same number of days, even if nobody tested positive on one of the days
#The data frame will have a length of rows and length of columns based on the number of days of testing and the number of markers tested

#To get the cumulative values for each column for each day I will first use the cumsum() function on each column and safe these newly created vectors with new vector names
#Once I have created vectors of accumulated sums for each column in dfcx and dfcy I will combine them all together using cbind()

#First processing everything for country X:
mar1cumx <- cumsum(dfcx$Marker_01_X)

#since each subject is positive in the data frame, in order to get the cumulative number of
#positive subjects I will create a new column titled "cum_pos_subjects_X" and fill it with 1's
#then I can apply "cumsum()" to that column

#since each subject is positive in the data frame, in order to get the cumulative number of
